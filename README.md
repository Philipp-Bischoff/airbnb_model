As part of my personal portfolio project, I developed an App to help hosts and property managers or private people considering hosting their
apartment on airbnb,accurately predict the nightly rate for new Airbnb listings.With a machine learning model trained on 50,000 Airbnb listings,
my tool provides personalized pricing suggestions based on a variety of factors, including location, size as well as distances to city centers and metros.

I built the dashboard with an easy-to-use map visualization feature that allows users to easily explore and view listings.
By connecting the dashboard with an API to my machine learning model, users can quickly access valuable insights to help them make data-driven pricing decisions.
